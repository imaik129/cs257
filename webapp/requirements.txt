STORY: A user can build their own playlist and sort their playlist according to the specified conditions. (Artist name, title, rating, etc) 

IMPLEMENTATION: One way to do this is by having a search bar with categories(where you specify what you want to search for *artist, title, release date*) Once the results are displayed below, there will be a plus button which you can click to add the song to a list. Potentially, we could display the list of songs(in a table format) with several headers which we could click to sort by. The default order of the songs in the list will be by rating(unless specified otherwise), and only the top 100 or 500 will be returned.

Other requirements: 
-Data Visualizer? Option to create charts based on certain categories
-Have an advanced search capability.(search for more than multiple categories at the same time)
-Have a way to manage your playlist you make(add, delete, save(save results as csv file onto local machine?), etc).
